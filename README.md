# features 
- The project simulates a scientific calculator using a PIC18F4620 microcontroller.

- Two keypads are connected: one for basic arithmetic and one for scientific functions.

- An LCD module displays calculations and results like 40*sin(30)/tan(45).

- Keypads and LCD are wired to the microcontroller for input and output operations.

- The Proteus simulation is active, and the design is functioning as expected.
